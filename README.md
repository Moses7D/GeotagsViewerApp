# GeotagsViewerApp
 
This app is part of a project for the needs of the course "Advanced Interfaces (Mobile Devices Programming)" that I attend to at International Hellenic University. The project's subject is the development of two apps, one app where the user can mark his current location on a map, customize this mark (colour, title, snippet), collect data from one environmental sensor on his phone and upload these data to a firestore database, and another app where users can view all these marks and their data on a map. This app is the viewer app.
